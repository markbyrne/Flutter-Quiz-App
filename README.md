## Flutter Quiz App Demo

This project is a basic **cross-platform Quiz App** demo, developed using **Flutter** and coded in **Dart**.  
The current question database is loaded with Flutter quiz questions, but it can be easily converted to other topics.  

The demo is hosted on **Firebase** â€” check out the live Quiz Web App [here](https://flutter-quiz-app-demo-rugburn.web.app/).  

This project also makes use of **unit testing** to ensure that navigation, structure, and behavior function as expected with any future changes.
